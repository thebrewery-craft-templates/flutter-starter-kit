# flutter_parse_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

To start, edit `./lib/applications_constants.dart` and go to `Craft > My Apps > Your App > Settings` 
and copy and replace the corresponding values of the ff:

```
const String keyParseApplicationId = 'APPLICATION_ID';
const String keyParseClientKey = 'CLIENT_KEY';
const String keyParseServerUrl = 'https://<subdomain>.apps.dev.thebrewery.app';
const String keyLiveQuery = 'wss://<subdomain>.apps.dev.thebrewery.app';
```

And you are ready to run your new Flutter app.
